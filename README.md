 Feature 2 (Anup Kandel): "Starting Journey"
 - I am an international student here in Finland. Before coming here, I had planned to study in Canada and had already started that process. However, during that journey, I realized that one thing was missing in every consultancy I approached: guidance in selecting a college and course based on my personal preferences. I had planned to apply to different locations, but many consultancies did not know about that and when I visit in-person then many of them kills my time with no result. At that time, I felt that if there had been a consultancy that could listen to my preferences and notified me when a suitable college and course were available, it would have made the process much easier and saves my times. This idea inspired the feature on this website.
